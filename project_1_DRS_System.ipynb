    "### tkinter \n",
    "- Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python.\n",
    "Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. \n",
    "Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n",
    "- https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/gui-tkinter-python\n",
    "### PIL - Python Image Library\n",
    "- Tkinter’s label widget can be used to display either images or text. \n",
    "To display an image requires the use of Image and ImageTk imported from the Python Pillow (aka PIL) package.\n",
    "- https://www.datacamp.com/community/news/essential-pil-pillow-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning-people-e3uhrbqm94m\n",

    "### Functools — Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects in Python\n",
    "- Function in Python is said to be of higher order. \n",
    "It means that it can be passed as argument to another function and/or can return other function as well. \n",
    "The functools module provides important utilities for such higher order functions.\n",
    "- partial - is used ti call a function that returns another function\n",
    "- https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-partial-functions/#:~:text=The%20partial%20function\n",
    "### threading\n",
    "-  a thread is defined as the smallest unit of execution with the independent set of instructions\n",
    "During threading, different processors run on a single program and each one of them performs\n",
    "an independent task simultaneously. threading is used to create threds that can work together\n",
    "- bascically it can be used to make one part of code to sleep for some time so that, \n",
    "another part is running and after sleep time is over then gets back and runs remaining part.\n",
    "- A daemon thread will shut down immediately when the program terminates.\n",
    "- Without daemon threads, you'd have to keep track of them, and tell them to exit, before your program can completely quit. By     setting them as daemon threads, you can let them run and forget about them, and when your program quits, any daemon threads     are killed automatically.\n",
    "- https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/programming/threading-in-python\n",
    "### time\n",
    "- The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code.\n",
    "- It also provides functionality other than representing time, \n",
    "- like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.\n",
    "### imutils\n",
    "- Imutils are a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as \n",
    "  translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV.\n"
